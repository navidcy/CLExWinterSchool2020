# Simulations

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the animations used in the presentation. The Jupyter notebooks run [Julia](https://www.julialang.org) (which happens to be the "Ju" in Jupyter).

- `twodnavierstokes_decaying.ipynb`: Simulation of decaying 2D turbulence on a doubly-periodic domain. 
- `barotropicqg_betadecay.ipynb`: Simulation of decaying barotropiq quasi-geostrophic turbulence on a beta-plane.
